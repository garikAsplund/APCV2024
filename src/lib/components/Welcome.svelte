Welcome to the 15th Asia-Pacific Conference on Vision
On behalf of the organizing committee, we are delighted to welcome you all to the 15th APCV in Osaka, Japan.
Vision science benefits from highly interdisciplinary research, from physiology to social behavior, engineering, and art. Recent advances of computational approaches boost interdisciplinary collaborations. We are convinced that APCV is one of the best conferences for diverse and fascinating discussions for all topics related to vision and beyond. To expand our understanding of related fields further, APCV2019 invites internationally distinguished researchers for keynotes from very different disciplines. This year, the conference program includes four keynotes, 13 symposia, 50 talks, and 220 poster presentations, and is the largest one in the history of APCV. We sincerely hope that this conference will be as successful as the previous APCVs.
In addition to Europe (ECVP) and north America (VSS), the Asia-Pacific is now the third largest region in vision science in terms of the number of researchers. APCV gives us opportunity to gather at one place with short trips and small jet-lags without having to invert day and night. And relatively low costs of travel help young researchers to join. To further this goal, registration fee for graduate students is reduced, and undergraduate students can attend without any charges.
We hope all of you have an enjoyable stay in Osaka, where one can find interesting parks, historical places, and research institutes as well as excellent local food and dishes.
August in Japan is going to be hot. We encourage you to check weather forecasts, wear cool clothes, and drink water during your stay in Osaka.
